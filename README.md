# Machine Learning & NLP-1

## Use mtcars data set(built-in in R, type ?mtcars for details)

 a. Run linear regression of mpg on hp, explain the coefficient(in real life terms, with the unit of variable) and goodness of fit.

 b. Run a polynomials regression of mpg on hp, up to 6 degree, use the rank matrix to select the model you think is the best in terms of bias-variance trade-off, justify your answers.
